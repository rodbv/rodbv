### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer and tech lead currently working for an Australian fintech.

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working with Node, React and AWS to support the development of a pretty cool international financial platform.
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Python3 and Django/Django Rest Framework, contributing to projects like [Querido Diario](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario)
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about agile development, kanban, RESTful APIs, Ecmascript, TDD, clean code, functional programming
- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: my twitter handle is @rodbv
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ¥´  Fun fact: When I was a kid I'd walk 30 minutes to spend 3 minutes on the ATM, doing whatever my mom needed. That's how nerdy I was before I had a computer. And then I got a ZX-81 clone with MS-BASIC and I was hooked.
