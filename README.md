### Hi there 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and tech lead currently working for an Australian fintech.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Node, React and AWS to support the development of a pretty cool international financial platform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, and refreshing my Python skills, as I believe the Python community is the coolest there is :)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source project that involves: front-end development with React 16, APIs in Django or Node, or anything cool
- 💬 Ask me about agile development, kanban, programming in general!
- 📫 How to reach me: my twitter handle is @rodbv
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🥴 Fun fact: When I was a kid I'd walk 30 minutes to spend 3 minutes on the ATM, doing whatever my mom needed. That's how nerdy I was before I had a computer.
