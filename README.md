### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer and tech lead currently working for an Australian fintech.

- ğŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working with Node, React and AWS to support the development of a pretty cool international financial platform.
- ğŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Python3 (last time I worked with Python it was on 2.7) and Django/Django Rest Framework
- ğŸ’¬  Ask me about agile development, kanban, RESTful APIs, Ecmascript, programming in general
- ğŸ“«  How to reach me: my twitter handle is @rodbv
- ğŸ˜„  Pronouns: He/Him
- ğŸ¥´  Fun fact: When I was a kid I'd walk 30 minutes to spend 3 minutes on the ATM, doing whatever my mom needed. That's how nerdy I was before I had a computer.
